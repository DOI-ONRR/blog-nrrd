If you are a regular reader of our blog, you might already know that we recently completed a redesign of [onrr.gov](https://onrr.gov/). This redesign included an update of the user interface. In addition, we focused on writing [accessible](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/four-part-hybrid-testing/) content in accordance to the [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/law/). This blog post outlines the efforts we took to rewrite [onrr.gov](https://onrr.gov/) in plain language, as well as how we coordinated with content owners. We hope that other agencies can apply our strategies and lessons learned to their own websites.

## Recieving a new product

In 2020, our Open Data, Design, and Development (ODDD) team started with managing and redesigning [onrr.gov](https://onrr.gov/). We are a [small team]( https://github.com/ONRR/nrrd/wiki/Joining-the-Open-Data,-Design,-and-Development-(ODDD)-project-team#project-team), and taking on a new website in addition to maintaining and innovating on our Natural Resources Revenue Data (NRRD) [site](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/) was a daunting task. We wrote about how we adjusted to adding a product to our portfolio in a [previous blog post](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/adding-a-product/). Early user research and user-centered design techniques like [card sorting](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/card-sort/) and [tree testing](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/treetest/) helped us get [stakeholder buy-in](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/stakeholders/). This initial work allowed us to dive into rewriting content in plain language. 

### A note on getting buy-in

Our stakeholders already had experience working with us through our [508 compliance project](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/accessibility/) and participating in user research about [accessibility](https://blog-nrrd.doi.gov/508-Study/). These previous projects allowed our stakeholders to get to know our team, and we were able to build a rapport with them. Because of this, it was easy for us to get them on board with plain language concepts. It is also important to note that we have vocal support from our upper leadership to make accessibility a priority. Having buy-in from the top of our organization helps drive our team's projects. This support also helped our stakeholders understand that these changes align with our agency’s goals and values.

## Prototype

Our ODDD team does not own, or is not responsible for, the content on the website. During the initial prototype process, we worked with the content owners, or subject matter experts (SMEs), to reduce reading levels on their respective webpages. Instead of asking the SMEs to rewrite content themselves, our team did all the initial rewrites for every webpage. It was much easier to get SME participation by asking them to review and revise rather than asking them to start from scratch!

We proposed rewritten content that had lowered reading levels, with our goal being [grade 10]( https://github.com/DOI-ONRR/nrrd/wiki/Content-style-guide#plain-language). Within this rewritten content, we incorporated [plain language guidelines]( https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) like: 

- Add useful headings
- Incorporate lists
- Incorporate tables and other visuals
- Write in simple words and phrases
- Write in short sentences and paragraphs
- Write in active voice and present tense
- Avoid jargon and abbreviations

After we sent the SMEs our proposed rewrites, they would review and revise. This became an iterative process, because the SME revisions would usually be over a grade 10 reading level and incorporate difficult language or jargon that we would need to edit again. 
In order to help the SMEs understand why we were rewriting in plain language, we used the free online version of [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/). At the time of this project, our agency’s Microsoft products did not include the [Editor function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/microsoft-editor-checks-grammar-and-more-in-documents-mail-and-the-web-91ecbe1b-d021-4e9e-a82e-abc4cd7163d7). We recently got access and plan on also using this function in future work. Regardless of which function you have access to, using an unbiased software to evaluate the text helped us illustrate the readability issues that we wanted to resolve. Once the SMEs saw the Hemingway results, they were more willing to negotiate with us and work with our proposed changes. 

Through this iterative process, we were able to reduce reading levels on all webpages compared to the old site. Because some of the content on the website is technical and not meant for the general public, not all pages got down to grade 10, but were still reduced. When we couldn’t get the reading levels down to grade 10, we made sure the page contained other plain language concepts listed above.

## Hemingway example: late payment interest

On the [late payment interest page](https://onrr.gov/paying/interest), the text on the old website was at a grade 14 reading level. The text consisted of two long paragraphs with complex sentences as well as passive voice. On the right side of the webpage, there was a green pop-up button that opened additional content. There was even more content lower on the page that required a significant amount of scrolling.
