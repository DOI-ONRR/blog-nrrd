During the challenging times of the pandemic, I stumbled upon a remarkable opportunity that not only allowed me to gain valuable experience but also make a meaningful difference. The Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS) internship program opened new doors for me, leading me to intern with the [Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR)]( https://onrr.gov/). In this blog, I will share my journey of how I discovered the [VSFS program]( https://careers.state.gov/interns-fellows/virtual-student-federal-service/) program, what drew me to intern with ONRR, and the impact it had on my career goals.

## Discovering the VSFS internship program

As the pandemic restricted in-person opportunities, I learned about the VSFS program through a friend who was interning in another agency. Intrigued by the idea of virtual internships, I decided to apply and was fortunate to be accepted as an Analytics Intern with the [Department of Veteran Affairs' Digital Media Engagement Team]( https://digital.va.gov/). My positive experience during the summer encouraged me to apply again when applications opened for the regular school year.

## Choosing ONRR

While exploring the possibilities, I came across ONRR and its [open data website]( https://revenuedata.doi.gov/). This was my first encounter with a user-friendly and informative website created by the federal government. I was captivated by the wealth of revenue and disbursements data available and recognized the opportunity to gain experience in analyzing such crucial information.

## Learning new akills

The internship at ONRR provided me with the chance to learn and master new skills. I gained proficiency in using GitHub for larger repositories, including pushing, committing, and branching changes. Additionally, I acquired knowledge in product management and UX/UI design best practices, which proved invaluable throughout my time at ONRR. Participating in user interviews for the recently redesigned [onrr.gov]( https://onrr.gov/) website taught me how to guide users and extract actionable insights from their feedback.

## Surprises and challenges

One of the biggest surprises during my ONRR internship was the involvement of every team member in the design process. From the product manager to the UX/UI designer, and even myself as a data intern, we collaborated to create and iterate designs, aiming for the best visualizations and displays. However, this also posed a challenge as I had limited experience with design work and visualization best practices. Through this internship, I had the opportunity to work on various visualizations, including [homepage charts]( https://revenuedata.doi.gov/) and [renewable fact sheets]( https://revenuedata.doi.gov/?tab=tab-fact-sheets), which helped me expand my skill set.

## Making a difference

Without a doubt, I can confidently say that my work and the collective efforts of our team at ONRR have made a tangible difference. My contribution involved updating and ensuring the accuracy of the data displayed on our website. Moreover, I worked on design projects and addressed issues that were eventually implemented on the live site. Additionally, I was involved in internal projects, such as the development of a data checklist to enhance our data verification process before publication.

## Memorable projects

Among the many projects I had the privilege to work on, the [fiscal year renewable fact sheets]( https://revenuedata.doi.gov/?tab=tab-fact-sheets) stand out as a personal favorite. From visualizing disbursements to gathering revenue and production data, I had the opportunity to be involved in various aspects of creating these.

## Career goals and the internship's influence

With my goal set on becoming a data scientist, my time at ONRR has been instrumental in paving the way for various opportunities. During interviews and professional settings, I proudly mention my work at ONRR and highlight the significance of providing accurate and transparent data to the general public. This internship played a vital role in securing internships with the [Securities and Exchange Commission]( https://www.sec.gov/) and a seasonal job with [San Francisco's Department of Elections]( https://sf.gov/departments/department-elections). As I approach the completion of my master's program, I am thrilled to continue my journey in the public sector at the local government level as a [San Francisco Fellow](https://sfdhr.org/sffellows) for the upcoming year.
