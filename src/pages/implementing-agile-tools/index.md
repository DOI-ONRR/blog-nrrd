Last summer I completed a job rotation with ONRR’s Open Data, Design, and Development (ODDD) team.  I wrote a blog post for them and I’d like to encourage you to read it to get my initial reflections on my experience and my excitement around Agile Management.  It can be found here: Open Data, Design, & Development team  (link()

Today, I’d like to share with you how I have incorporated some of the things I learned during my rotation.  First, I made some changes to how I manage my workload.                                                                                                 

## Organizing tasks

For the past two years I’ve been trying to become better at tracking tasks and prioritizing them.  I began using sticky notes on a Kanban Board (link) on my wall.  The ODDD team tracks every item of work as an issue in a platform called GitHub (link).  During their sprint review they discuss the status of each remaining open issue on ZenHub (link), using a Kanban layout.  After my rotation, I created a digital Kanban board using Service Now’s Visual Tack Board (check out the Tech Tip on Page 4).  The benefit to my board being digital is that a board can be shared with colleagues, tasks can be assigned to individual contributors, due dates can be added, and a checklist can be created.

## Effective communication

Another take-away for me was how to be more effective in my communication as a remote worker.  The ODDD team has a list of best practices on their Wiki called Basics for making distributed work work (link).  Some things that have resonated with me are defaulting to video for meetings (there are times I think this is not ideal- such as ONRR All Hands meetings); setting aside time for meeting prep (and time after for finishing notes or entering to-do items into my Visual Task Board); and treating everyone as remote- I think this last piece will be critical once we have folks transition back into the office.

Beyond these two areas where I’ve already began to make personal changes in how I operate every day, I’ve taken my observations from the Open Data, Design, and Development team and thought about how RRM could use some of their methodologies to improve internal communication and knowledge sharing.

I gained a lot of knowledge, experience, and perspective during my job rotation.  But the most valuable thing I gained was new friends.  I remain in contact with the team.  I’ve popped into team meetings to bounce ideas off of them, asked individuals for help with things I can’t figure out, and chatted them up.  This is my way of trying to break down silos at ONRR.

I would highly encourage everyone to participate in a job rotation.  I think these opportunities provide a great way for getting familiar with the work that other parts of our organization perform, having context for how they use our services and products, creating relationships across the organization and breaking down silos, and seeing how different teams are run.  Expanding your knowledge and skill set is always beneficial.
