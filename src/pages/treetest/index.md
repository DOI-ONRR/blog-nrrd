As we’ve approached the redesign of onrr.gov, we’ve done several rounds of user testing, including open and closed card sorting ). The card sorting helped us determine the categories and subcategories that users would want to see on the home page. We wanted to further confirm that we were placing the subcategories into the correct main categories and that users would be able to find the needed information, so we turned to tree testing. Tree testing was a new type of user research to our program analysts so we read a few [articles] (https://www.optimalworkshop.com/learn/101s/tree-testing/ ) to get up to speed with our UX expert.

## Getting started
Our first step in the process was to figure out how to use our existing or free software to conduct the tree testing. After some investigation, our UX expert determined that a [clickable prototype]( https://wkvlqa.axshare.com/) would serve our needs. We used the software that our expert already uses for prototyping so she could quickly create the testing materials. You could use any software that allows clickable interfaces to do the same thing.

## Planning the study
Our goals were to validate the structure that came out of tree testing, determine whether users could find items that were hard to categorize in the card sort, and determine if we needed to change any category labels. We wanted to have common tasks that would direct users to each main category so we could really get a feel for how users search for information on our site and limited it to 10 tasks, since users learn the categories quickly in tree testing. We dug into past research to help us determine the user tasks and had our teammates peer review to make sure that our tasks were realistic and encompassed common user needs. Our UX expert also created 3 different versions of the prototype with the tasks randomly organized in a different order to remove some bias in the task order.

We also decided to show a [wireframe]( https://wkvlqa.axshare.com/#g=1&p=homepage) of the homepage using the categories after the tree test tasks, so users could see where we were headed with the site using the categories and get some feedback on the categories in context.
