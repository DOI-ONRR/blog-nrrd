# A blog from the Innovation Design Team at the Department of the Interior

Our team works on [Natural Resources Revenue Data](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/), an [open data](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data) site about how the government manages federal energy and mineral resources, revenue, and disbursements.

We built this blog with [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/) using the [`gatsby-starter-blog`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

We use this blog to share our user-centered design and development process.
